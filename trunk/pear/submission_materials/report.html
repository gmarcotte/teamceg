  <h2>Final Report:</h2>
  <h3>Reflections on the process as a whole</h3>
  
  <p>[[A final report, in report.html, that describes how well the project worked out. How did your milestones go? What was your experience with design, interfaces, testing, etc.? What surprises, pleasant or otherwise, did you encounter on the way? What choices did you make that worked out well or badly? What would you like to do if there were more time? How would you do things differently next time? What should next year's class learn from your experience? Imagine that you are writing this document for your (friendly!) boss or professor and want to explain what you learned that could be applied to the next project. ]]</p>
  <p>- The report is the most important single piece of documentation</p>
  <p>report: real insight, thoughtful, informative / straightforward "this is what we did" / repetitive; uncoordinated sections / little evidence of thought or effort</p>
  
  Outline:
  
  milestones
      a strategy: be optimistic so you always have that kick in the butt
      an alternate strategy: be generous in milestones so you feel good and want to keep working
      we chose realistic middle ground strategy (expect less during iw due dates, midterms, etc.: but still we were a little behind all the time
      
  design
      in terms of server, switched from apache/_/_ to plain mac server on christina's old macbook pro
      in terms of data flow, we followed our basic design
  
  interfaces
      in terms of UI, fluid, as we incorporated new elements sometimes we had to modify overall design, but generally well planned: ended up keeping the skeleton of the UI initially designed as a test run
      
  testing
      we tested as we went
      but didn't have enough core functionality to test it as leisurely or thoroughly as we would have liked
      
  surprises
      switched text editors
      pyjamas source code is incomplete / has terrifying comments
      pyjamas and javascript is difficult
      
  good/bad choices
      good: using django (garrett's strength, saved us a lot of coding and headache)
      good: svn (seeing source updates also helped see what other members were doing)
      good/bad: pyjamas is still young but writing python is incredibly convenient and clean
      bad: waiting so long to put things together
      
  if more time...
      (so much!)
      TA/instructor mode with help requests
      incorporate an audio chat
      see other user's mouse
      (as per comment at demo) consider allowing other editors
      test it ourselves by writing some of our code using our app
      
  differently next time
      consider gwt over pyjamas
      not have to switch open source editors/console details so late in the game (in the last couple weeks)
      get core functionality done First (not just pieces of core functionality), by beta test at latest so can improve, test before demo
      repeat to emphasize- really, really push to get core functionality to test-able level by beta demo!
