<p> Pair programming is a popular work model both in education and general
software development. The concept is very simple: two people work in tandem
to produce code.  One assumes the action position (which we call the driver)
and is responsible for actively writing, building, running and debugging
the code.  The other assumes a more passive position (which we call the
passenger), and is responsible for providing advice, watching out for 
mistakes, and keeping track of the progress of the project on a more
conceptual level.  Every so often, the pair switches positions to ensure
both are getting practice both reading and reviewing the code.

<p>
This can be a wonderful model under the right circumstances and contribute
greatly to the productivity, education, and experience of the programmers.
However, it suffers from logistical difficulties.  Where can they both meet?
What computer are they going to use?  Where are the files going to live, and
when the pair switches roles, how will they transfer from one computer/account
to another?  In today's world of global collaboration, tremendous diversity of
technologies, and increased concerns about security, these difficulties can
eliminate pair programming as an option from the very start.

<p>
Enter Pairgramming.  As a browser-based pair-programming environment, there
are no concerns about needing to work on a single computer or in the same location.
Programmers in Silicon Valley can collaborate seamlessly with partners in India 
or China.  A single development server can be configured for an entire class
of students, and they can load a full programming environment from any internet-
enabled computer.  Automatic integration with the Subversion version control
system provides backups, easy file sharing, and change history for an entire
project.  Collaboration via text chat keeps the ideas flowing freely between
the two programmers.  With all of the features of Pairgramming, collaboration
is seamless and pair programming is once again a viable option for schools
and software developers around the world.
