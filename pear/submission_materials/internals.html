  <h2>Internals</h2>
  
  <p>[[Developer information, in a file called internals.html. This should describe the internal structure of the software for the developers who will take over after you sell your company, with enough detail that they could continue to evolve your system once you're gone. State clearly the development environment (operating system, languages, compilers, frameworks, etc.) where the system can be built, and the environment where it will run. If you used major components like Rails or Django, these must be noted, along with your best guess about how to get copies. Do not include them! We won't try to recreate your system, but we want to see how it's put together, spelled out carefully enough that we could imagine taking it over if so motivated. Don't get mired in detail, however; 3-4 pages are likely to be sufficient. ]]</p>

  <h3>Server Environment</h3>
  The current server environment is a Mac, with Django running in Apache and mysql. Pyjamas, the other framework we use, can run on any system with Python. The server requirements are relatively minimal, in that any system with Python that will run Apache and mysql will do. 
  
  <h3>Structure of Framework Interactions</h3>
  The server that we maintain (ie not the servers that the programmers actually work on, but the server that manages all of our interactions between users) runs Django running on Apache. Django is used for all of the user management tasks. Pyjamas is used to build the actual Pairgramming application that the two users log into to execute sessions. The Pyjamas app is implemented entirely in Basic.py and Basic.html, which also relies on several opensource javascript modules (EditArea, for the editor, and Ajaxterm, for the console).
  
  <h3>Pushing Changes to the Server</h3>
  Given our current setup, to push changes to the server you need to update the code on the server (using just plain old svn update), rebuild the pyjamas app using /var/django/teamceg/pear/pjstuff/build.sh (only if there were changes to Basic.py or Basic.html).
  If changes were made to any of the ajaxterm code, then the ajaxterm daemon must be restarted. First find any runaway ajaxterm daemon processes using: ps aux | grep ajaxterm. Kill these processes, and then cd into /var/django/teamceg/pear/pjstuff/public/ajaxterm and execute the command sudo -u www python ajaxterm.py -d in order to restart the daemon. (Typically, you will need to restart the daemon only when an unable to resolve host error occurs in a user console, which is rare but has been known to happen). Finally, execute: sudo apachectl restart, to restart Apache. 
  
  
<h3>Pyjamas</h3>  
  Pyjamas is an opensource port of the GWT in Python. It can be obtained from their Sourceforge repository (http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=239074). Their homepage is also accessible at http://www.pyjs.org.
  
  Pyjamas was used to implement the Pairgramming app, which is where the users actually do all of their coding. Pyjamas is really a compiler, so after writing your pyjamas app in python, in order to actually launch it you must run a build script which compiles all of the python code you have written into a single javascript file (pygwt.js) and several html output files for different browser versions. These output files must then be integrated with your webserver (in our case, Django) to actually be accessed by your users.
  
  <h3>Integrating Pyjamas and Javascript</h3>
  Pyjamas is an interesting toolkit because it allows you to program in python and then compile to Javascript, however the communication and integration between Pyjamas and Javascript is not well documented and is very messy. The DOM module within Pyjamas is sketchy at best, and integrating with open-source Javascript projects is tricky, especially when updating dynamically from the Django server. 
  <p>
  In order to integrate Pyjamas and Javascript modules, the Pyjamas documentation suggests writing a Python wrapper class to encapsulate all of the javascript calls you will need using their "JS" command. Do not even bother until they have improved the backend for this. Functions in this area of Pyjamas are often literally defined as "pass" when they claim to make significant changes to DOM elements and attributes. Instead, we found that using element IDs and listener HTML areas within the Pyjamas app were the best way to communicate between the modules. For instance, for the editor in our app, we have an editor listener html div which simply contains the messages that the open source editor and the Pyjamas app need to exchange. Think of these as two-way mailbox buffers, and you will be able to set up a working connection. One caveat is that this code gets <i>very</i> messy, so it is best to enforce strict naming and function setting policies within your own code, or you will be hopelessly lost.
  <p>
 Also, the latest versions of pyjamas are not always entirely stable, so we would recommend picking a revision and staying at that revision during your development, rather than trying to deal with bugs that are periodically introduced. Pyjamas is very young right now, so we are hopeful that the documentation issues and frustrations we had will be resolved as it matures and grows more of a user base.

  <h3>Integrating Pyjamas Django</h3>
  In order to integrate Pyjamas and Django so that our app could get management information from the server and use the server to communicate between two users in a session we used a series of JSON calls. Pyjamas provides a relatively stable and intuitive JSON interface, allowing the pyjamas app to send and receive responses from the Django server. On the server side, we implemented a JSON view in order to process these requests.
