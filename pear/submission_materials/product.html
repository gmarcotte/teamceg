  <h2>Product Promotion</h2>

  <p>[[Advertising material, starting in a page called product.html: teaser web page, short product description, screen shots, tutorial sequences, etc. This is the part that explains to potential customers or users what's neat about your project. The content and format are up to you, but try to make it short and seductive. (It's better if it works with all browsers and does not require plug-ins, but we will mainly use Firefox and perhaps Safari.) ]]</p>
  <p>advertising: appealing, attractive / straightforward listing of features / sloppy, careless</p>
