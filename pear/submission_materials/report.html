  <h2>Final Report:</h2>
  <h3>Reflections on our Pairgramming journey</h3>
  
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>We've come a long way.  There were times when we were thrilled with ourselves and our progress, and then to be honest there were times when we hated Javascript/open source/other and just wanted to be done and get some sleep.  But overall, this project has been an extremely educational, positive experience that we would all do again.  </p>
  
  <h4>Setting Milestones</h4>
  <p>When we were starting this project and making milestones for the design doc, we considered two main strategies.  On one hand, you could be optimistic and set early deadlines that also served to provide you motivation.  On the other hand, you could be generous so that you could actually achieve your milestones and use the positive feeling of being on schedule to push you to keep working as early as possible.  We chose to use a realistic middle ground, allowing less progress during midterms and independent work deadlines.  However, we were consistently a little behind (an incorporated console for one person instead of for two, for instance).  But we did a good job setting new goals for ourselves.  Before parting from every meeting, we made sure to decide when we would next meet, and assign individual progress goals.  This helped us keep making progress throughout the semester; so we had just a lot of work to do in the last week, instead of all the work.  </p>
  
  <h4>Intelligent design</h4>
  <p>Regarding design, our final implementation basically followed the data flow we had decided on during the planning stages of our project.  Indeed, one of our strenghts as a group was probably talking through plans for everything as early as possible so that we had considered the possible consequences of every design decision we were making in the beginning.  This was fortunate because I think it would have been very difficult to make major changes after we had started writing the actual code.  In terms of the server, we did make a switch for our convenience.  We were having problems setting up a FIXME server on Christina's old Macbook Pro, so we ended up using the eas<i>ier</i> -if not easy- Mac server that come built in. </p>
  
  <h4>UI</h4>
  <p>In terms of interfaces, we were pretty fluid.  We ended up keeping the UI initially designed as a test run for the alpha test.  As we incorporated new elements into the application, we modified the necessary parts of the code.  After many modifications to little pieces at a time, by the end, the Pyjamas code only had the same skeleton as from the alpha test.  As we learned the language and available packages better, we were able to greatly simplify code we had written much earlier. </p>
  
  <h4>Test, test, test, repeat!</h4>
  <p>We basically tested as we wrote, testing each component as we added it.  Throughout the project, we would test to make sure previously added parts hadn't become broken, and maintained a list of issues that worked well to not forget to go back and fix something.  Our consolidated list worked much better than lists on scraps of coffee napkins or personal hard copies because we could see them at any time as a whole.  In terms of having outside testers, however, we didn't have as many testing runs as we would have liked.  While we enlisted several testers early in the project's development, we didn't have full functionality early enough to have multiple runs with the same testers as we would have liked.  But we had planned to have testers with a variety of familiarity with programming: complete novice who had never seen a program or taken any COS courses, students who had completed COS 126 here, students wh ohad completed COS 333 last year, Dr. Dondero.  We felt the complete novice was important because he would not have any learned notions of common coding practice or our potential implementation details; we wanted to be sure the novice could not break our product.  Then on the other end of the spectrum, we wanted to make sure Dr. Dondero or the COS 333 alum could not too easily break our project.  Unfortunately, we were not able to utilize testers beyond the three of us.  But we tested as much as we could after each component was added. </p>
  
  <h4>Surprise!</h4>
  <p>During the course of this project development, we encountered many surprises, some pleasant and some less than pleasant.  One very pleasant surprise was EditArea, the open source text editor we found and ended up adapting for our final application.  It had much fewer bugs than the open source Helene text editor we had initially decided on!  However, one very frustrating surprise was with Pyjamas.  We had known starting the project that Pyjamas was still a very young, new framework, but we didn't know that there were still some serious bugs, incomplete source code, and functions they decided to remove in the past couple months.  "FIXME" and "Do not use this function yet!!! it will only bring you grief (FIXME what's the exact quote???)" were found in the source code more times than we would have liked.  Unfortunately, many of these instances were in functions that were very important to us, such as incorporation of Javascript into Pyjamas code.  </p>
  
  <h4>Some Good Decisions</h4>
  <p>Looking back, we definitely made some good decisions.  One was using Django.  It saved us a lot of coding and database coordination.  It also helped that Garrett was our resident Django expert and had a lot of experience and code from the Prince to reference.  Another good decision was setting up and using a google code site (http://code.google.com/p/teamceg/).  It was very convenient for collecting all of our technology and setup information, meeting minutes, seeing source code and its changes, unresolved issues/bug lists, etc. in one website.  It was also convenient to check on each others' progress regularly.  The meeting minutes helped us set short-term goals and keep making progress, and made writing up the Timeline much easier.  Overall, using Pyjamas was still worth it.  It was simpler to use one language (Python) for Django and Pyjamas.  Plus, Python is just cleaner (syntax, function names, etc.) than Java or Javascript.  Additionally, we were careful not to use open source products, source code or frameworks which had been abandoned or not updated recently.  Abandoned projects were abandoned for a reason, and wouldn't have the benefit of being improved and fixed up.  </p>
  
  <h4>Expansion Possibilities</h4>
  <p>There are so many things we would have added if we had possessed more time!  We knew starting this project that there were a lot of bells and whistles that could make this Pairgramming application the ultimate package.  However, we also knew we were only three people and we only had about 8-9 weeks to pull it off, in addition to our other classes.  One major addition we would have liked is a TA/instructor mode, where they could log in and see projects which students had requested (or requested then cancelled) help for.  The list could be sorted by request time or by status of students involved (currently logged in or not); then the TA/instructor could pull up and join a project as an observer and chat with the students about their problem and see the code real-time, instead of reading vague or out-dated e-mails.  Another feature is an integrated audio chat.  We chose to use Skype due to limited resources but initially we had hoped to write our own basic audio chat and integrate it with our application so they wouldn't have to download, install, or run Skype separately.  Another useful feature would be seeing the other user's mouse location in real-time so they could point to parts of the screen/text.  As someone asked after our demo, it would be neat to offer more options for text editors, but we simply didn't have the resources to accomplish this for this deadline.  It would also have been cool to make a desktop application of our Pairgramming application, which in theory would not be too difficult since there is a Pyjamas Desktop which accepts the same code as for Pyjamas.  Finally, it would have been really cool to use our product in writing some of our code for this project, kind of a proof of usefulness in its own production.  But we didn't have core functionality done early enough to do any significant coding using our own product.  </p>
  
  <h4>If we could do it all over again...</h4>
  <p>If we had the privilege of another opportunity like this one, there are some things we would do differently.  We would probably seriously consider using the more popular GWT instead of Pyjamas, since it is older, more tested, and has better documentation.  We would also spend even more time researching our open source options, and not be afraid of foreign language developers because English is so dominant that most of the documentation was in English anyway.  Also, we would not trust open source demo's.  We initially decided to use Helene because the demo on their website was promising and claimed a lot of bugs in the demo were not in the recent versions; this turned out to be not quite true.  Similarly, we initially passed over the amazing EditArea editor because we were disappointed by a limited-functionality demo.  Basically, be wary of open source.  Open source products are going to be the best and worst thing to happen to you; it's great that it saves you a lot of designing and coding, but often it's seriously flawed and isn't quite suitable for your purposes.  Open source products are usually open source for a reason.  And though we've mentioned it a couple times already, we really highly recommend that the core functionality of the project be implemented by the beta test, even if it means an all-nighter because an all-nighter before the beta test means you still have over a week to test and refine and fix bugs; this is infinitely preferable over an all-nighter before the demo or before dean's date (not that we had to do either of course..).  Finally, don't bite off more than you can chew.  We knew this was an ambitious project when we started, but we didn't fully realize just how ambitious it was for our small team and limited resources.  However, as a result, we are quite proud of what we've accomplished.  And we're really glad that we were able to work on this project which we were each engaged and passionate about.  It's just such a cool project!  It's amazing to look back on how much code we've written, and on how much we've learned (languages like Python and Javascript, frameworks like Django and Pyjamas, benefits and dangers of using open source, on and on). </p>
