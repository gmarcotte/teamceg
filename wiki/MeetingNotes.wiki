= Introduction =
Running record of notes from our team meetings. 

= Sun, March 1 =

== For Next Week ==
 * Start working on the design document (this is due right before spring break). 
 * Try to be able to connect to our sever (waiting on response from OIT).

== Server Notes ==
Ubuntu server has been installed on old mac. Seems to be working, but we cannot ping it or ssh to it. We sent a request to OIT to figure out how to make this work. The alias is teamceg.princeton.edu.

Server also has Django already.

== Pyjamas and other Things ==
Pyjamas, Django and a few other things are now in source. 

== SVN ==
Everyone now is able to checkout from SVN and has a version of trunk on their local machine.
