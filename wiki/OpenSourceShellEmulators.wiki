Open Source/Available Shell Emulators 

== Introduction ==
These are the open-source shell emulators that I have found that seem to actually be functional.


== Details ==


-*PHPterm* (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpterm/) on sourceforge. Not terribly well documented, only screen shot examples.

-*PHPshell* () on sourceforge. Also not particularly well documented and no working demos available.

-*MindTerm* (http://www.appgate.com/index/products/mindterm/) from AppGate free license up to 25 non-commercial. Relatively well-documented (Java Applet). Can handle SSH1 and SSH2 protocols for us. Found several working demos as well. Some CS departments actually seem to be using this as a way to log into linux servers remotely for students. (http://www-stu.cai.cam.ac.uk/ssh/)
